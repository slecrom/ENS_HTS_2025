# AI for code

As Master's students, enhancing your coding skills is crucial, and leveraging generative AI tools can significantly accelerate coding efficiency and quality. These tools can help you write, debug, and optimize code faster, allowing you to focus on solving complex biological problems rather than getting stuck on syntax or logic issues.
Embrace these technologies to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving field of bioinformatics!

The following tools are excellent resources:

* [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
* [Claude code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)
* [OpenAI's GPT models](https://chat.openai.com/)
* [Google's Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)
* [Codestral from Mistral Le Chat](https://chat.mistral.ai/chat)

Many of these tools offer free versions for students, making them accessible for your academic projects. 

!!! note "Additional tips"

	* Start with simple tasks and gradually increase the complexity.
	* While these tools are powerful, they are not a replacement for understanding the underlying concepts.
	* You should always critically evaluate the output of these tools and not blindly trust it.
