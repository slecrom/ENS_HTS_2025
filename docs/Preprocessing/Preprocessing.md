## Introduction

!!! caution "Objective of this practical session"

	During this practical session, you will learn:	

	* To perform experimental biases estimation and correction of microarrays GPR files. You will first perform **quality control** of the imaged glass slides before choosing the best normalisation method to apply.
		
	* To conduct an analysis of RNA-seq raw fastq files. You will first perform **quality control** of the sequencer file outputs before proceding to the **mapping** of the reads onto the reference genome and normalise your data.


***

## Microarrays data preprocessing


### Set up your working environment

Connect to Rstudio server of the IFB. Look at the [tutorial on how to connect to IFB-core Rstudio server](../IFB_OpenOnDemand.md) to see how to proceed.

### Save the working notebook in your personal environment
	
1. In "*File > Open File...*" enter the path `/shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/data/tutorials/preprocessing_microarrays.Rmd` to open the notebook containing all the code needed for the practical.

&nbsp;
2. Save it into your personal folder on your IFB account using "*File > Save As*". You can access the path of your home folder using "~".
 
### Follow the instruction of the notebook to conduct the analysis
	
You can also visualize the final [report version](preprocessing_microarrays_report.html).

## RNAseq data preprocessing


### Set up your working environment

Connect to the IFB-core JupyterLab server. Look at the [tutorial](../IFB_OpenOnDemand.md#using-a-jupyterlab-session-to-access-unix-terminal) to see how to proceed. You can also look at the [useful commands to work on the IFB-core Cluster](../Usefultips.md) page.

Go to your home directory
```
cd 
```

Create a directory that will contain all results of the upcoming analyses
```
mkdir RNAseq
```

Go to the newly created directory
```
cd RNAseq
```

Check your are in the right directory using the `pwd` command
```
pwd
/shared/home/<your login>/RNAseq
```

### Sequence quality controls

!!! note "Fastq files"
	**Fastq** files are raw results from RNA-seq experiments. These files comprise all the **sequences** (or reads) obtained from the sequencer device (Illumina technology in this practical), together with **base quality scores** (PHRED scores).

Two different files will be analyzed during this practical from Guida *et al.* publication:

- ***O2rep2_SRR352263.fastq*** refereed to a transcriptome analysis of yeasts *C. parapsilosis* under normoxic condition ([ENA access number: SRR352263](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRR352263))
- ***noO2rep3_SRR352271.fastq*** refereed to a transcriptome analysis of yeasts *C. parapsilosis* under hypoxic condition ([ENA access number: SRR352271](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRR352271))

In a first step, controls will be performed on each FASTQ files in order to evaluate the overall quality of the sequences and identify potential problems that could impact the following analyses. During this practical we will use the [**FastQC**](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) software solution.

!!! note "FastQC"
	FastQC is a quality control application for high throughput sequence data. It provides an interactive application to review the results of several different quality control checks, and create an **HTML based report**.
	
	The main functions of FastQC are:
	
	- **Import of data** from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
	- Providing a **quick overview** to tell you in which areas there may be problems
	- **Summary graphs** and tables to quickly assess your data
	- Export of results to an **HTML based report**
	- **Offline operation mode** to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application

!!! tip "What you have to do"
	1. Use FASTQC to evaluate the quality of sequences in each FASTQ files. Using information from the [Fastqc help page](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help) as well as exemples of [good](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/good_sequence_short_fastqc.html) or  [bad](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/bad_sequence_fastqc.html) illumina data as references.
	2. &nbsp; Compare results between the two FASTQ files. Is there any concern related to the following analyses?

#### Create a new directory to store the output of fastqc

```
mkdir 1-QC

# Using the `tree` command, your directory should look like this:
tree
│
└───1-QC
```

#### Go to this directory

```
cd 1-QC
```

#### Make fastqc available in your environment

```
module load fastqc/0.12.1
```

#### Run fastqc on each experiment files

```
# Absolute path to the file:
# /shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/data/rnaseq/O2rep2_SRR352263.fastq
#
# -o option creates all output files in the specified output directory,
# '.' means current directory

# O2 condition
fastqc /shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/data/rnaseq/O2rep2_SRR352263.fastq -o .

# noO2 condition
fastqc /shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/data/rnaseq/noO2rep3_SRR352271.fastq -o .
```

At this point you should see the new files in your directory using the `tree` command

```
tree
│
└───1-QC
	└─── O2rep2_SRR352263.fastqc.html
	└─── O2rep2_SRR352263.fastqc.zip
	└─── noO2rep3_SRR352271.fastqc.html
	└─── noO2rep3_SRR352271.fastqc.zip
```

#### Open the HTML file reports on your local machine

Select "Home directory", from the "Files" menu of your IFB cluster Open On Demand dashboard.
Navigate through the "1-QC" directory and open the *.html* reports using your internet browser.

### Mapping of reads on the reference genome

Once data quality is verified, reads will be mapped onto the reference genome of yeast *C. parapsilosis*. The **genome sequence** of *C. parapsilosis* and its **annotations** (locations of ORFs) were retrieved from the [Candidat genome database (CGD)](http://www.candidagenome.org/).

!!! note "Bowtie"
	Different aligner and algorithms for RNA-seq analysis exist. We will use [**Bowtie 1.3**](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml) an ultrafast (memory-efficient) short read aligner.
	
	As an input, Bowtie uses a **Fastq file** (with reads to be aligned) and **“pre-built indexes”** of the reference genome. These indexes are named ***“C_parapsilosis.1.ebwt”***, ***“C_parapsilosis.2.ebwt”***, etc. They will allow boosting the alignment process.  

	As an output, Bowtie provides a **SAM file**. SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) is a generic format for storing large nucleotide sequence alignments.

!!! tip "What you have to do"  
	- Run sequence alignments with Bowtie using the two Fastq files
	- While Bowtie is running, take a look at [Bowtie documentation](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml#the-bowtie-aligner) that describes the options (particularly the *-m*)
	- Look at the alignment statistic outputs (file .out)
	- What is the proportion of reads aligned on the reference genome?
	- Is there any concern to take into account for the following analyses?

#### Create a new directory to store the output of bowtie

```
#Go back to the parental directory "RNAseq"
cd ../

#Create a new directory to store results of the alignment
mkdir 2-Mapping
```

Your directory should now look like this :
```
tree
│
└───1-QC
	└─── O2rep2_SRR352263.fastqc.html
	└─── O2rep2_SRR352263.fastqc.zip
	└─── noO2rep3_SRR352271.fastqc.html
	└─── noO2rep3_SRR352271.fastqc.zip
└─── 2-Mapping
```

#### Go to the newly created directory

```
cd 2-Mapping
```

#### Load Bowtie into your environment

```
module load bowtie/1.3.1
```

#### Map the reads to the reference genome

```
## We will use the following options:
# "-S" will output the result in SAM format
#
# "/shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/data/rnaseq/bowtie_indexes/C_parapsilosis"
# specify the location and the "prefix (C_parapsilosis)"" of the bowtie's
# index files
#
# "/shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/data/rnaseq/Fastqc/O2rep2_SRR352263.fastq.gz"
# location of the input fastq
#
# "2>" will save in a file some statistics about the aligment (number of  
# reads mapped, etc...)
#
# "> redirects the mapping output into a .sam file

# Map the aerobic condition reads
bowtie -S /shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/data/rnaseq/bowtie_indexes/C_parapsilosis /shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/data/rnaseq/O2rep2_SRR352263.fastq 2> O2rep2_SRR352263_bowtie_mapping.out > O2rep2_SRR352263_bowtie_mapping.sam

# Map the hypoxic condition reads
bowtie -S /shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/data/rnaseq/bowtie_indexes/C_parapsilosis /shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/data/rnaseq/noO2rep3_SRR352271.fastq 2> noO2rep3_SRR352271_bowtie_mapping.out > noO2rep3_SRR352271_bowtie_mapping.sam
```

Your directory should now look like this :

```
tree
.
├── 1-QC
│   ├── O2rep2_SRR352263_fastqc.html
│   ├── O2rep2_SRR352263_fastqc.zip
│   ├── noO2rep3_SRR352271_fastqc.html

    ├── noO2rep3_SRR352271_bowtie_mapping.out
    └── noO2rep3_SRR352271_bowtie_mapping.sam
```

Take a look at the outputs of the mapping step

```
less O2rep2_SRR352263_bowtie_mapping.out 
# reads processed: 10213665
# reads with at least one reported alignment: 9160950 (89.69%)
# reads that failed to align: 1052715 (10.31%)
# reported 9160950 alignments

less noO2rep3_SRR352271_bowtie_mapping.out
# reads processed: 10136009
# reads with at least one reported alignment: 9252408 (91.28%)
# reads that failed to align: 883601 (8.72%)
# reported 9252408 alignment

```

### Post-processing of alignment files

In order to facilitate alignement manipulation, **SAM files** have to be converted into **BAM files** (a binary version) and alignements “sorted” according to their localisation on the genome and files indexed in order to speed up their access. We will use the [**Samtools**](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) suite to perform these steps.

!!! tip "What you have to do"
	- Convert SAM files into BAM files
	- Sort and index BAM files

#### Sort and convert *.sam* into *.bam* files

```
## "samtools sort" sort alignments by genomic coordinates
# "|" "pipe" the output of samtools sort to the next program
#
## "samtools view" will convert sam into bam
# option "-b" specify the output to be in BAM format
# ">"" write the output in the bam file

module load samtools/1.21

# Sort and convert O2 condition
samtools sort O2rep2_SRR352263_bowtie_mapping.sam | samtools view -b  > O2rep2_SRR352263_bowtie_sorted.bam

# Sort and convert noO2 condition
samtools sort noO2rep3_SRR352271_bowtie_mapping.sam | samtools view -b  > noO2rep3_SRR352271_bowtie_sorted.bam
```

!!! danger "Error message using samtools"
	If you get an error message during samtools execution, check that you booked 2G of RAM for your JupyterLab environment.


#### Create indexes for the bam files

The index of a bam file is named ***.bam.bai***

```
# Index the O2 condition
samtools index O2rep2_SRR352263_bowtie_sorted.bam

# Index the noO2 condition
samtools index noO2rep3_SRR352271_bowtie_sorted.bam
```

```

### Gene counts estimation

To identify genes whose expression is different between hypoxic and normoxic conditions, we will **count and compare the number of reads mapped to each ORF**. A program available in the [**Bedtools**]( https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2) suite will be used for this purpose.

!!! tip "What you have to do"
	- Calculate for each ORF the number of reads that were aligned (normoxic and hypoxic conditions).

#### Create a new directory to store the ORF count matrix

```
# Go to the parental directory "RNAseq"
cd ../

# Create a new directory to store results of the alignment
mkdir 3-Counts
```

Your directory should now look like this :
