# Dataset

Data used in this practical were collected from the following publication: Guida, A., Lindst√§dt, C., Maguire, S. L., Ding, C., Higgins, D. G., Corton, N. J., Berriman, M., et al. (2011). Using RNA-seq to determine the transcriptional landscape and the hypoxic response of the pathogenic yeast *Candida parapsilosis*. [Guida *et al*. BMC Genomics 2011](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-12-628)

The authors used high throughput technologies (*microarrays and high throughput sequencing*) to determine the transcriptional profile of the pathogenic yeast *Candida parapsilosis* growing in several conditions including media, temperature and oxygen concentrations.

You will use the datasets related to the study of the hypoxic (low oxygen) response in *C. parapsilosis*.

The raw sequencing files located into the projet data folder of the IFB-core Cluster : `/shared/projects/2528_ens_master2lf_fgat/rnaseq/` where retrieved from the [EBI European Electronic Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) using the study accession number [PRJNA154483](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA154483).
